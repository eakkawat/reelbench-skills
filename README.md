# reelbench-skills

Claude Code / Codex skills for working with video.

| skill | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| [video-shots](skills/video-shots/README.md) | **Shot breakdown**: turns a finished film into a shot-by-shot table — duration, shot size, category, camera move, frame description. Cuts and durations are measured by ffmpeg; the model only judges the four things it should; 14 quality gates check every call. |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eternityspring/reelbench-skills.git
cd reelbench-skills
./scripts/install.sh
```

This symlinks the skills into `~/.claude/skills/` and/or `~/.codex/skills/` (whichever exists),
so **`git pull` takes effect immediately**.

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --claude      # Claude Code only
./scripts/install.sh --codex       # codex only
./scripts/install.sh video-shots   # one skill only
./scripts/install.sh --uninstall   # remove the symlinks
```

Requirements: `node` >= 18 and `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` (macOS: `brew install node ffmpeg`).
**No npm dependencies, no API keys** — it runs on your current session.

Prefer a copy over a symlink? `cp -r skills/video-shots ~/.claude/skills/` —
each skill is self-contained.

## Example

`demo-report/` is the **real output** of running the skill on `demo-video.mp4`
(a 202.9-second AI-generated short film, *啥是AI*): 53 shots, 3.83 s average shot length,
15.7 cuts per minute, all 14 gates green.

[![Shot breakdown report](skills/video-shots/assets/report.png)](demo-report/shots-report.html)

The report is a **single interactive page**: an embedded player (playback highlights the current
shot, click a shot to jump), a pace strip, a shot list you can search, filter and sort (list or
card view, first and last keyframe side by side, click a frame to enlarge), distributions, cast,
and the quality gates. No external dependencies — double-click it offline.
